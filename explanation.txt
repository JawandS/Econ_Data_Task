District 1 has about 13.6 employees per establishment and district 11 has about 22.6. It seems that in district one the more prominent industries are ones where less people need to be employed. For example, district one has a significantly larger agriculture/forestry/fishing industry (74 vs 3 establishments) which doesn't need too many people per establishment. Similarily with construction district 1 has more. On the other hand the information industry, which has a significant number of people per establishment is much more prominent in district 11 (36k vs 4k employees). Therefore I think in district 11 labor would be a higher sunk cost since there would be more competition for labor and more labor needed for the average business. As a result, in the short run labor would be a greater sunk cost since wages would likely be higher.
